                 draft-wang-sidr-fcbgp-framework-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for the framework of
   Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP).  Forwarding Commitment（FC）is a
   cryptographically signed code to certify an AS's routing intent on
   its directly connected hops.  Based on FC, the goal of FC-BGP is to
   build a secure inter-domain system that can simultaneously
   authenticate AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE and validate network
   forwarding on the dataplane.

1.  Introduction

   The fundamental cause of the path manipulation attacks in Internet
   inter-domain routing is that the de facto Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP) [RFC4271] does not have built-in mechanisms to authenticate
   routing announcements.  As a result, an adversary can announce
   virtually arbitrary paths to a prefix while the network cannot
   effectively verify the authenticity of the route announcements.

   In addition to the lack of control plane authentication, ensuring
   that the actual forwarding paths in the dataplane comply with the
   control plane decisions is also missing in today's inter-domain
   routing system.  This fundamentally limits ASes from filtering
   unwanted traffic which takes an unauthorized AS path.

   The representative schemes to secure inter-domain routing are RPKI
   [RFC6480] and BGPsec [RFC8205].  RPKI provides a foundation for
   validating the origins of BGP routes.  Meanwhile, BGPsec directly
   builds the path authentication of BGP routes into the BGP path
   construction itself, where an AS is required to iteratively verify
   the signatures of each prior AS hop before extending the verification
   chain with its own approval.  As a result, a single legacy or
   malicious AS can terminate the verification chain, preventing the
   downstream ASes from reinstating the verification process.  This
   creates the well-known chicken-and-egg problem where the early
   adopters receive no deployment benefits which further limits new
   adoption.

   Finally, due to the lack of practical protocols to check the
   consistency between the dataplane forwarding and control-plane
   decisions, enforcing path authorization in the inter-domain
   forwarding has been not possible to date.

   This document specifies a framework named FC-BGP, an incrementally
   deployable security augment to the Internet inter-domain routing and
   forwarding.  FC-BGP relies on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
   (RPKI) certificates that attest to the allocation of AS number and IP
   address resources.  To support FC-BGP, a BGP speaker needs to possess
   a private key associated with an RPKI router certificate [RFC8209]
   that corresponds to the BGP speaker's AS number.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Threat Model and Assumptions

   We assume that ASes participating in FC-BGP have access to RPKI,
   which stores authoritative information about the mapping between AS
   numbers and their owned IP prefixes, as well as ASes' public keys.
   Given the above assumptions, we consider the following adversary:

   1.  On the control plane, the adversary can launch path manipulation
       attacks.  This means that the adversary will try to manipulate
       the routing paths to victim ASes or prefixes by sending bogus BGP
       updates.  For example, the adversary might try to reroute traffic
       to the victim ASes/prefixes through ASes that they control, in
       order to perform (encrypted) traffic analysis.

   2.  On the dataplane, the adversary can spoof source addresses and
       send unwanted network traffic to the victim ASes prefixes.

                       Figure 1: Overview of FC-BGP.

   An overview of FC-BGP is shown in Figure 1.  The key primitive in FC-
   BGP is the Forwarding Commitment (FC), which is a publicly verifiable
   code that certifies an AS's routing intent on one of its directly
   connected hops, i.e., an FC indicates whether the AS is willing to
   carry traffic for a specific prefix over the hop.  Upon receiving a
   BGP announcement, if AS A decides to accept the route and extends the
   path to its (selected) neighbor AS B, AS A commits its routing intent
   by generating a cryptographically-signed FC.  Therefore, downstream
   on-path ASes (such as AS B) can validate the correctness of a BGP
   update by checking the FCs associated with the individual hops on the
   AS-path.  Because the FCs are designed to be hop-specific and path-
   agnostic, a deployed AS can immediately certify its routing intent
   regardless of the deployment status of other ASes.  This is
   fundamentally different from existing path-level BGP authentication
   protocol (e.g., BGPsec) where an on-path AS cannot approve any form
   of routing intent unless all on-path ASes are upgraded.

   FC-BGP is not bound to a specific FC propagation method and can use,
   but is not limited to, the following mechanisms:

   1.  Extend BGP Update Message.  Assign a new BGP Update Path
       Attribute to carry FCs, see draft XXX for more details.

   2.  Propose a new propagation protocol that guarantees consistent FC
       propagation, see draft XXX for more details.

   3.  Use existing network infrastructure, such as extending RPKI to
       add a new signed object to store FCs, see draft XXX for more
       details.

   Meanwhile, the flexibility of FCs further enables efficient
   forwarding validation on the dataplane.  Specifically, because the
   FCs are self-proving, an AS can conceptually construct a certified
   AS-path using a list of consecutive per-hop FCs, and then binds its
   network traffic (identified by < src-AS, dst-AS, prefix >) to the
   path, such as < AS B, AS A, P(B) >, where P(B) is the prefix owned by
   AS B destined to AS A.  This binding information essentially defines
   the authorized forwarding path for the traffic < AS B, AS A, P(B) >.
   Therefore, by advertising the binding information globally, both on-
   path and off-path ASes are aware of the desired forwarding paths so
   that they can collaboratively discard unwanted traffic that takes
   unauthorized paths.

   Similar to FC propagation, the propagation of binding messages in FC-
   BGP is not restricted to specific methods and can be, but is not
   limited to, the following:

   1.  Propose a new propagation protocol that guarantees the
       consistency of binding messages, see draft XXX for more details.

   2.  Use existing network infrastructure, such as extending RPKI to
       add a new signed object to store binding messages, see draft XXX
       for more details.

4.  Forwarding Commitment

   FC-BGP enhances the security of inter-domain routing and forwarding
   by building a publicly verifiable view on the forwarding commitments.
   At a high-level, a routing commitment (FC) of an AS is a
   cryptographically-signed primitive that binds the AS's routing
   decisions (e.g. willing to forward traffic for a prefix via one of
   its directly-connected hops).  With this view, ASes are able to:

   1.  Evaluate the authenticity (or security) of the control plane BGP
       announcements based on committed routing decisions from relevant
       ASes.

   2.  Ensure that the dataplane forwarding is consistent with the
       routing decisions committed in the control plane.

   Upon receiving a BGP announcement, an upgraded AS generates a
   corresponding FC that contains the core information of the
   announcement, such as prefixes, sending AS and receiving AS, and will
   be signed with the sender's private key for security.  See draft XXX
   for specific structure of FC.

        |<----------------+------------------+------------------+
                      F(A,B,P)-(src:P(D),dst:P(A))

                        Figure 2: Example of FC-BGP.

   Consider an illustrative example using the four-AS topology shown in
   Figure 2.  In this process, FC-BGP generates the corresponding FC and
   propagates to downstream ASes (e.g., adding it to the Path Attributes
   of the BGP updates), so that the receiving AS can validate the
   authenticity of the announcement.  Suppose AS C receives a BGP
   announcement P(A): A->B->C from its neighbor B.  If AS C decides to
   further advertise this path to its neighbor D based on its routing
   policy, it generates a FC F(C,D,P), propagates it to AS D, and
   forwards the BGP update message to D.

   When AS D receives the route from C, it can determine the
   authenticity of the current AS path by verifying the list of FCs
   correctly reflects the AS path.

6.  Forwarding Validation

   AS shown in Figure 2, to enable forwarding validation, ASes need to
   announce the traffic-FCs binding relationships.  Specifically,
   suppose AS D confirms that the AS-path C->B->A for reaching prefix
   P(A) is legitimate, it binds the traffic (src:P(D),dst:P(A)) (where
   P(D) is the prefix owned by AS D) with the FC list F(C,D,P)-F(B,C,P)-
   F(A,B,P), and then publicly announces the binding relationship.

   Upon receiving the relationship, other ASes can build traffic
   filtering rules based on the relationship to enable forwarding
   validation on dataplane.  For instance, by interpreting the binding
   relationship produced by AS D, AS C confirms that the traffic
   (src:P(D), dst:P(A)) shall be forwarded over the link L(CD), and AS B
   confirms that the traffic shall be forwarded on link L(BC).  Network
   traffic violating these binding rules is considered to take
   unauthorized paths.

   To enable network-wide forwarding verification, these binding rules
   may be further broadcast globally (instead of just informing the ASes
   on the AS-path) so that off-path ASes can also discard unauthorized
   flows.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Security Guarantees

   When FC-BGP used in conjunction with origin validation, the following
   security guarantees can be achieved:

   1.  The source AS in a route announcement is authorized.

   2.  FC-BGP speakers on the AS-Path are authorized to propagate the
       route announcements.

   3.  The forwarding path of packets is consistent with the routing
       path announced by the FC-BGP speakers.

   FC-BGP is designed to enhance the security of control plane routing
   and dataplane forwarding in the Internet at the network layer.
   Specifically, FC-BGP allows an AS to independently prove its BGP
   routing decisions with publicly verifiable cryptography commitments,
   based on which any on-path AS can verify the authenticity of a BGP
   path; meanwhile FC-BGP ensures the consistency between the control
   plane and dataplane, i.e., the network traffic shall take the
   forwarding path that is consistent with the control plane routing
   decisions, or otherwise be discarded.  More crucially, the above
   security guarantees offered by FC-BGP are not binary, i.e., secure or
   non-secure.  Instead, the security benefits are strictly
   monotonically increasing as the deployment rate of FC-BGP (i.e., the
   percentage of ASes that are upgraded to support FC-BGP) increases.
